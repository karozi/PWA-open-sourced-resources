- Use `curl` to debug APIs, reproduce bugs, and automate content ops.
- Add `-v` for verbose (debug), `-L` to follow redirects, and `-o <file>` to save output.
- For OAuth/JWT-protected APIs, always pass the correct `Authorization` header.
- Wrap common curl calls into shell scripts for repeatable workflows.
