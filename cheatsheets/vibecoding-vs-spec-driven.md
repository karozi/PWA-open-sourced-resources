# Vibecoding vs. Specâ€‘Driven: The AI Development Lexicon That Actually Ships

AI coding feels like alphabet soup until you give it a spine. This gist translates the buzzwords into working categories so builders ship faster without turning their repo into a gremlin farm.

## The First Prompt Matters (More Than You Think)

Youâ€™re building a homepage. What you feed the AI sets the entire trajectory: a vague wish list invites improvisation; a grounded spec turns intent into code paths and tests.

## The Six Methods, Minus the Handâ€‘waving

- **Vibecoding** â€” Hand the wheel to the AI from natural language. If it runs, you ship. Fast, fun, and opinionatedâ€¦ like hiring a confident junior who redecorates your architecture.
- **Specâ€‘Driven Development** â€” Prompt â†’ Spec â†’ Design â†’ Tasks â†’ Code. A living artifact that guides, validates, and documents. Boring in the best way.
- **Context Engineering** â€” Curate multiâ€‘source inputs (PRD, personas, brand, policies, tests) so the model guesses less and hallucinates rarely.
- **Prompt Engineering** â€” Constraintâ€‘rich instructions. Role, task, format, success criteria. Baseline literacy in 2025.
- **AIâ€‘Assisted Engineering** â€” Humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop. The AI drafts; you review, test, and integrate. Enterprise default because auditors like sleep.
- **Agentic Coding** â€” Goalâ€‘driven autonomous agents that plan and adapt. Powerful, still fragile. Oversight is not optional.

## Where Each Wins (And Where It Breaks)

- Prototypes: **Vibecoding** for velocityâ€”follow with review or enjoy your technical debt garden.
- Production: **Specâ€‘Driven** for durability, team handoffs, and fewer midnight incidents.
- Accuracy: **Context + Prompts** cut hallucinations and raise predictability.
- Team speed: **AIâ€‘Assisted** scales within CI/CD without sacrificing discipline.
- Automation: **Agentic** for multiâ€‘stage workflows; add guardrails unless chaos is your aesthetic.

## The Part No One Talks About: Disclose Your Method

A vibecoded prototype â‰  a specâ€‘driven build â‰  an agentic experiment. Say which path you took. It clarifies risks, sets expectations, and keeps future you from cursing present you.
