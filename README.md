## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Vibecoding (Rapid Prototyping)
- Start with `cheatsheets/vibecoding-vs-spec-driven.md`
- Use when exploring ideas, testing hypotheses, or creating demos
- Perfect for: MVPs, prototypes, user research sprints

### For Spec-Driven Development (Production-Ready)
- Follow the frameworks in `cheatsheets/`
- Use when building production features, scaling systems, or working in teams
- Perfect for: Production code, maintainable systems, team collaboration

### For API Development
- Check out `cheatsheets/curl-cheatsheet.md`
- Essential commands for testing, debugging, and automating API workflows

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Move fast, but with purpose." — *Product With Attitude*

This repository embodies two core principles:

1. **Ship faster, break fewer things**: Product-grade AI builds need guardrails and systems
2. **Reduce entropy**: Spec-driven scaffolds + vibecoding loops keep development on track

---

## 🎓 When to Use Each Approach

### Use Vibecoding When:
- Exploring new ideas or UX concepts
- Testing hypotheses quickly
- Creating demos for stakeholder feedback
- Prototyping before committing to architecture

### Use Spec-Driven When:
- Building production features
- Working with distributed teams
- Maintaining complex systems
- Ensuring long-term maintainability

### The Sweet Spot:
Cycle between both: **vibe → spec → vibe → spec** as your project evolves.
