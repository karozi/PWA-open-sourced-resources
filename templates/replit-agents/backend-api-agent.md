🧠 **Prompt: Build a Robust Backend API – Clean Architecture & Production-Ready**

You are a senior backend engineer tasked with building a **production-ready REST API** using one of the following stacks:

- [Node.js + Express]
- [Python (Flask or FastAPI)]
- [Java Spring Boot]

---

### 🎯 Objective:
Build a backend system for **[insert your system description here, e.g., "a subscription-based learning platform" or "a hotel booking API"]** using **clean architecture** principles. The result should be modular, maintainable, secure, and deployment-ready.

---

### 🛠️ Tech Requirements:

Please implement the following features:

#### ✅ Project Architecture
1. Use **layered clean architecture** (e.g., domain → service → controller).
2. Modularize features into folders or packages.
3. Apply **dependency injection** where applicable.

#### ✅ Core Functionality
4. Implement **authentication & authorization** (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
5. Add **input validation** for all endpoints (use libraries like Zod, Joi, Pydantic, etc.).
6. Include **error handling middleware** with clear messages & status codes.

#### ✅ Infrastructure & Operations
7. Add a **logging system** (e.g., Winston, Loguru, or SLF4J).
8. Set up **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
9. Support **API versioning** (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
10. Implement **health checks** (`/health`) and **monitoring endpoints** (e.g., `/metrics`).

#### ✅ Documentation & Developer Experience
11. Auto-generate API docs using **Swagger/OpenAPI**.
12. Include detailed **README.md** explaining:
    - Setup instructions
    - Environment config
    - How to run tests
    - Deployment steps
13. Containerize the app with a **Dockerfile** and provide:
    - `docker-compose.yml` (if multi-service)
    - Deployment guide (local + cloud options)

---

### 📦 Output Expectations

- Output the result as a **complete folder structure** with all files (`.js`, `.py`, `.java`, `.yaml`, etc.).
- Include clear **inline comments** and documentation.
- Format the code according to best practices of the chosen stack.
- Bonus: Include minimal **unit test coverage** for at least 2 routes.

---

### 🧠 Decision Making (Optional)

- Briefly explain **why you chose this stack and architecture.**
- Note any **tradeoffs** made during implementation (e.g., skipped features, simplified modules).

---

### 🧪 Examples of Descriptive Inputs:
Replace `[insert your system description]` with something like:
- “An API for managing freelance job listings and contracts”
- “A backend for a movie ticket booking system”
- “A user profile and recommendation engine for a fitness app”

---

### 🧯 Constraints
- Do **not** include any frontend code.
- Do **not** use frameworks that auto-generate full projects (e.g., JHipster).
- Keep code **modular and readable**, suitable for small teams to build upon.
