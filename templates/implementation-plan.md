## Project Context
*One-paragraph overview of the feature or product, the problem it solves, and its intended impact on users and the business. Include relevant background so that anyone opening this document can quickly understand scope and purpose.*

---

## 1. Objective
**Purpose:** Translate the PRD into a clear, execution-ready sequence for engineering, design, QA, and go-to-market teams.  
**Success Definition:** Plan is considered complete when all phases are executed, KPIs are met or exceeded, risks are mitigated, and learnings are documented.

**Example KPIs:**
- Adoption rate: XX% within 30 days of launch
- Uptime: â‰¥ 99.9% in first month
- Accessibility compliance: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA
- Customer satisfaction score: â‰¥ 8/10 post-launch survey

---

## 2. Readiness Checklist (Preâ€“Phase 1)
âœ… All stakeholders identified and confirmed  
âœ… Tools, repositories, and environments ready  
âœ… Dependencies documented and owners assigned  
âœ… PRD is complete, accessible, and version-controlled  
âœ… Decision Log is linked and empty (ready for entries)
